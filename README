Introduction
------------

The RST Radar Operating Software (RST-ROS) is the software used to
operate the SuperDARN radar network. The software is distributed in
the form of source code and data tables for Linux platforms.

This package does not include the hardware interface software, instead
it contains a "dummy" radar task that simulates the responses of the
radar hardware.

Note the ROS code in this package is based on the RST 3.1 software used
at the Christmas Valley radars, and does not include all of the ROS 3.6+
updates in use at the Fort Hays or other MSI-style radars.


Features
--------

The RST-ROS package includes the following software:

+ radar          - A radar simulator
+ errlog         - The error logger
+ fitacfwrite    - Stores fitacf data files
+ rawacfwrite    - Stores rawacf data files
+ iqwrite        - Stores iqdat data files
+ rtserver       - Real-time data server for TCP/IP clients
+ shellserver    - Provides an interface between the control program
                   and the interactive shell
+ radarshell     - The interactive radar shell that allows control program
                   parameters to be changed
+ schedule       - The radar scheduler

The package also includes control programs, site libraries, and all
of the RST data processing and plotting functionality (e.g., dmapdump,
make_fit, time_plot, etc.).


Installation
------------

1. Install the required libraries (as of Ubuntu 22.04):

    build-essential
    libconfig-dev
    libhdf5-dev
    libncurses-dev
    libnetcdf-dev
    libpng-dev
    libx11-dev
    libxext-dev
    netpbm

2. Download the NASA CDF library (cdf[XX_X]-dist-cdf.tar.gz) from:

    https://spdf.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/software/cdf/dist/latest/linux/

Unpack and install the CDF software:

    tar -xzvf cdf[XX_X]-dist-cdf.tar.gz
    cd cdfXX_X-dist
    make OS=linux ENV=gnu all
    sudo make INSTALLDIR=/usr/local/cdf install

3. Load the RST-ROS environment variables by adding the following lines
to the end of ".bashrc":

    export RSTPATH="/home/radar_user/rst-ros"
    source $RSTPATH/.profile.bash

Refresh the profile to make sure the environment variables are up to date
by closing and re-opening the terminal, or by typing:

    source ~/.bashrc

4. Compile the build architecture by typing:

    make.build

5. Compile all of the RST-ROS software by typing:

    make.code

To recompile individual pieces of the software type:

    make.code [lib or bin] [optional search string]
    (e.g., make.code bin normalscan)

Logs of the compilation process are stored in the "log" sub-directory.


Data Directories
----------------

The directories in which data and log files are recorded are defined by
environment variables (in .profile/ros.bash). By default the following
directories are used:

/data/ros/iqdat        - iqdat files
/data/ros/rawacf       - rawacf files
/data/ros/fitacf       - fitacf files
/data/ros/snd          - snd files
/data/ros/errlog       - error logs
/data/ros/scdlog       - scheduler logs


Configuration Files
-------------------

The site-specific configuration files are found in directories along the
path defined by the SD_SITE_PATH environment variable (in .profile/ros.bash).
Each configuration file includes site-specific values for operating the
radar, which can now be modified without needing to recompile the site
libraries (or control programs). These values are loaded when each control
program begins, and the user can override them using command line arguments
to the control program.


Scheduling the radar
--------------------

The schedule files contain a list of starting times and control programs.

The format for the starting time is:  yr mo dy hr mn

    where   yr  is the four digit year (e.g., 2021)
            mo  is the two digit month (01 to 12)
            dy  is the two digit day of month (01 to 31)
            hr  is the two digit UT hour (00 to 23)
            mn  is the two digit UT minute (00 to 59)

The first non-comment line of the schedule file should name the default
control program to be run when no valid time has been reached, e.g.,

    default normalscan -stid -cve -fast -sb 0 -eb 19

All subsequent lines should contain a valid time followed by a control
program and its command line options, e.g.,

    2022 10 01 12 00 normalscan [command-line options]

Note that unlike previous versions of the ROS, it is no longer necessary
to specifiy the path where the control programs are located (this path
is now set by default to the USR_BINPATH environment variable).


Running the radar
-----------------

Two scripts control the operation of the radar:

start.radar   - starts the supporting tasks and scheduler process
stop.radar    - stops all radar tasks

Three scripts are available for testing the operation of the radar:

test.radar    - tests the operation of both radars
test.east     - tests the operation of the east radar
test.west     - tests the operation of the west radar

Note that when using the "dummy" radar simulator with the above test
scripts, the ROS hostname (or IP address) should be set to localhost
(or 127.0.0.1) using the "-ros" command line option with the appropriate
control program in the schedule file. Alternatively, the "ros.host" value
in the site configuration file can be set to 127.0.0.1 instead.
